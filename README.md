#Computer Engineering Curriculum

I created this repository to save and list all the courses that I took during my Computer Engineering degree journey at University of Livingstonia. University of Livingstonia is one of the leading university in Malawi that produces graduates who will go and transform industries by creating innovative solutions that can solve really world problems.

The department of Computer Engineering at University of Livingstonia is under the faculty of Applied Sciences. The objectives of this Programme are to:
